   <h1 style="color:#CED1D8; text-align:center; font-family:verdana; font-size: 180%;">The differences between a wired and wireless network</h1>

<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:5px;">
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 130%;">Wireless Networks are considered to be the future, no need for and annoying clutter of wires, just a simple Bluetooth or Wi-fi connection.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 130%;">To start off what are the similarities:</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 130%;">Well, obviously they both are able to connect to different types of networks with ease and after set up correctly can be used for all sorts of things.</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 130%;">However, there are many differences. One being the layout and difficulty of both. With a wireless network you don't have to worry about where certain wires will go as there are none, however, with this the connection may be a little bit delayed as you are not directly connecting to a network but using an internet service like Wi-fi.</p>
